Our database recycledb holds two tables.

1. bins: UUID will be created beforehand, then hashed to create the bin_path. Both UUID and bin_path will be inserted, and the timestamp will be autogenerated.
2. requests: Autogenerates an id and timestamp. Requires the bin row id as a foreign key. Requires the id from the entry in MongoDB that must be generated first before a request entry. Will store the request method and path from the webhook.
